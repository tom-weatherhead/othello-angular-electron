Installation for Windows 10 Home -> Windows Command Prompt without audio

!!! Note: Currently (2019-10-02), electron and chromium-browser do not run from WSL. But we can run our electron+docker+etc. Othello app on Windows with X-windows and PulseAudio by running it from the Windows command prompt. See platform-specific/Windows10Cmd.with-audio/*

- Running Docker Toolbox with WSL on Windows 10 Home: See https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-set-up-docker-and-windows-subsystem-for-linux-a-love-story-35c856968991/

- See https://dev.to/darksmile92/run-gui-app-in-linux-docker-container-on-windows-host-4kde :

- In an admin Windows command prompt: choco install vcxsrv
- Run XLaunch from the start menu and configure it as follows:
	- Display settings: Multiple windows; Display number: -1
	- Client startup: Start no client
	- Extra settings: Check everything, including 'Disable access control'
	- Finish configuration: Save it to the Desktop with a particular filename.

- Docker: Download and install Docker Toolbox (for Windows 10 Home) or Docker Desktop (for Windows 10 Pro or +)
	- Note: The programs in Docker Toolbox (e.g. docker.exe) can be run from either the Windows command prompt or a WSL shell (e.g. Ubuntu + Bash).

Then build and run the app:

rmdir /S dist
rmdir /S node_modules
del package-lock.json
npm i
npm start

build.bat
run.bat
